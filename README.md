# Hack the 6ix 2024 Landing page

## Getting started

1. Install Nodejs 20 (I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and also setting up [autoloading .nvmrc](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure proper version is used)
2. `cp .env.example .env.local` to make local copy of environment variables (Fill in any missing values from whatever secret manager)
3. `npm ci` to install the goods
4. `npm run dev` to start the goods
5. Profit
